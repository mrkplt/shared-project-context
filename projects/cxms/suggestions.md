# Template System Enhancement Suggestions

## Context Type Discovery
**Problem Identified**: Current system requires guessing valid project_id and file_type combinations, leading to failed attempts and "Field required" errors.

**Solution Discussion**: Template suggestion system to accelerate project setup and ensure consistency.

## Current Proven Context Types
Based on existing CXMS project examples:

### Universal Context Types
- **bugs**: Structured issue tracking with technical context, reproduction steps, and solution status
- **features**: Active feature documentation with implementation status, confidence levels, and usage examples  
- **session_summary**: Project changelog tracking actual work done, decisions made, and technical evolution
- **mental_model**: High-level architecture understanding, data flow, interfaces, and design decisions

## Template Categories Framework

### Universal Templates
Every project needs these core contexts:
- bugs (issue tracking)
- features (capability documentation) 
- session_summary (work history)
- mental_model (architecture overview)

### Domain-Specific Templates
Additional contexts based on project type:
- **web_app**: frontend_patterns, ui_components, routing_logic
- **api_service**: endpoints, auth_patterns, integration_tests
- **data_pipeline**: data_models, transformation_logic, quality_metrics
- **ml_pipeline**: model_experiments, training_data, performance_benchmarks

### Role-Specific Templates
Specialized contexts for specific concerns:
- **architecture_decisions**: design rationale, trade-offs, alternatives considered
- **performance_benchmarks**: metrics, optimization targets, bottleneck analysis
- **security_review**: threat model, mitigation strategies, compliance requirements

## Smart Suggestion Logic

```typescript
new_project("web-dashboard") 
→ suggests: universal + web_app + frontend_performance templates

new_project("ml-pipeline")
→ suggests: universal + data_pipeline + model_experiments templates

new_project("api-gateway") 
→ suggests: universal + api_service + security_review templates
```

## Key Insights from Analysis

**Decision-Informed Contexts**: These templates capture the "why" behind technical choices, current project state, and accumulated knowledge. Much more valuable than raw code storage.

**Workflow Patterns**: Templates aren't just structure - they encode proven approaches to different project types and collaborative workflows.

**Structured Approach**: Status indicators, confidence levels, verification dates make contexts actionable rather than just documentation.

**Technical Continuity**: Maintains coherent project vision across sessions while being specific enough to be genuinely useful.

## Implementation Considerations

### Template Selection Strategy
- **Template Inheritance**: Base universal templates + specialized additions
- **Flat Selection**: Choose from categorized template sets
- **Hybrid Approach**: Universal base with optional domain/role-specific additions

### Usage Pattern Learning
- Track which template combinations are most maintained
- Identify which sections within templates get the most updates
- Evolve templates based on actual usage patterns

### Template Evolution
- Current CXMS templates become seed library
- Templates improve based on real project maintenance patterns
- Domain-specific templates emerge from common project patterns

## Expected Benefits

**For Project Setup**:
- Eliminates blank page problem
- Reduces setup friction
- Ensures proper structure from day one

**For AI Collaboration**:
- Enables intelligent context suggestions: "This looks like an API project - want me to initialize with api_service templates?"
- Provides structured discovery instead of guessing valid combinations
- Maintains consistent collaboration patterns across projects

**For Knowledge Management**:
- Standardizes format across all projects
- Captures organizational best practices in reusable templates
- Enables cross-project pattern recognition and optimization
